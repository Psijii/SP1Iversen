# SCI MU - science museum for children and youths.
## Noroff Front End Development Course Spring 2023

This project is only for educational purposes only.

# Development and design

SCI mu was designed in Figma, and was inspired by several science museums, such as Science Museum in London, VilVite in Bergen, 
and Cit√© des sciences et de l'industrie in Paris.
Drawing inspiration was necessary to build a website for a fictional museum that would attract childrenadn youths that are interested in 
the diverse field of science.

During the development some of the original design were changed to optimalise user experience.

The site is built in HTML & CSS, with light use of JavaScript to make the navigation bar mobile-friendly.
It's built with flex box in CSS to make it much as possible mobile friendly.

## Reviews and feedback
The design and colours were changed during the development when user-feedback was received.
